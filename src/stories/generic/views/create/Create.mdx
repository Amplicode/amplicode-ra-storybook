# Create

The `<Create>` component is the main component for creation pages. It prepares a form submit handler, and renders the page title and actions. It is not responsible for rendering the actual form - thatâ€™s the job of its child component (usually a form component, like `<SimpleForm>`). This form component uses its children (`<Input>` components) to render each form input. [More information](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Create.html).
